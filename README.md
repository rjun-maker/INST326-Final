# INST326-Final

## Team RAAA members include Renee Jun, Aiden Anderson, Ademir Ferreyra, and Abdurakhmon (Abe) Tukhtasinov

### explanation
The final project is a zoo keeper simulator where the player can choose from 5 different randomized choices which results in a randomized range of effects. The player needs to win a certain amount of rounds to progress to the next level where they eventually can win the game. The player also needs to keep their budget and the animal's affection level in mind because if it goes below 0 you lose the game.

### how to run the program
Type: python3 changes_by_Abe.py

### how to use the program
Once you run the above command line in the terminal you will be greeted with a title screen and 5 different actions you can input. If you input a different action from the list presented or misspell it an error will pop up. Each time you input a choice based on the actions presented you can either gain or lose money and a pet score/affection which gets updated each round.
